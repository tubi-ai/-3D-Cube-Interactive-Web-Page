Objective:
This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates an interactive 3D cube that users can manipulate by clicking labeled buttons corresponding to the cube's faces. The cube rotates smoothly to display the selected face, providing an engaging visual experience.

Structure:
HTML Structure:

The HTML structure is minimalistic, containing essential elements to display the cube and control buttons. Key components include:
Labels & Radio Buttons: Each cube face ("Front," "Left," "Right," "Top," "Bottom," "Back") is associated with a corresponding radio button and label. When a label is clicked, it triggers the associated radio button, initiating a cube rotation.
Cube Container: The .container div houses the .cube div, which contains six face elements representing the sides of the cube.

CSS Styling:

Global Variables:
The code uses CSS variables (--size: 300px) to manage the cube's dimensions, making it easier to maintain and adjust the cube size.
General Styling:
The body element is styled to center the content both vertically and horizontally, ensuring the cube is the page's focal point.
Cube Styling:
Container: The .container class applies a 3D perspective (perspective: 1000px), essential for creating the 3D effect, and sets the cube's size.
Cube: The .cube class is where the cube's 3D transformation occurs. Initially, it is rotated by rotateX(-15deg) rotateY(15deg) to present a slightly tilted view of the cube. The transition property is set for smooth animations.
Faces: Each .face class represents a side of the cube, positioned in 3D space using translateZ() and rotate transformations. The box-shadow and opacity properties give the faces a subtle 3D effect.
Interactions:
Each face has a corresponding #face:checked ~ .container .cube CSS rule that triggers a specific rotation of the cube when the associated radio button is checked. For example, selecting the "Top" face will rotate the cube by 90 degrees along the X-axis (transform: rotateX(-90deg);).
Buttons:
The buttons are styled for a user-friendly appearance with hover effects to indicate interactivity. The buttons are arranged in a grid layout for easy selection.
Functionality:

Interactivity:

The cube's rotation is driven entirely by CSS. When a user clicks on a label, the corresponding radio button is checked, triggering the associated CSS transformation rule that rotates the cube to display the selected face.
Smooth Transitions:

The cube's movement is animated smoothly with a transition property, enhancing the user experience by providing a visually appealing and responsive interface.
Conclusion:
This code snippet effectively demonstrates a combination of HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript to create an interactive 3D cube. The use of CSS for both the 3D transformations and animations ensures a clean and efficient implementation. The code is well-structured, making it easy to understand and modify. The interactive buttons enhance the user experience by allowing seamless manipulation of the cube, making this a great example of interactive web design.
